# Contribution Guidelines for FCCSW

## Pull-requests

When creating a pull-request, state clearly what it is about by choosing a
meaningful title. The title is also used to create our release notes.

Give a bulleted list of things you address (mentioning related issues).

We are happy if you create pull-requests also if you feature is not ready, yet.
Please mar them as such by adding `[WIP]` to the start of the title. The purpose
of this is, for example, that you want to let other people know you are working
on a given issue. For these work-in-progress pull-request, we propose to have a
check list of things that still need to be done.



## Issue tracking

Use the github issue tracker. Reference the issues that you are working on. If
you notice an issue, consider first creating an issue and then refering to it in
your pull-request and commit messages with `#[issue-id]`.

## Code style

We have documented our coding style [here](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/FCCSW/blob/master/doc/CppCodingStyleGuidelines.md).
Please have a look. Consider using a clang-format plugin for your favorite editor.

## Github workflow

The general GitHub workflow is documented [here](http://fccsw.web.cern.ch/fccsw/tutorials/fcc-tutorials/FccSoftwareGit.html).
